title: My first blog with Jekyll and GitHub
---

After a few fist fights with Tumblr, followed by neglect and subsequent loss of my domain name, I decided it was time I jumped ship and found a better blogging tool. Here goes GitHub Pages and Jekyll!  If you see more posts on my GitHub site than at my previous <a href="http://datasciencegirl.tumblr.com/">Tumblr site!</a>, then you will know I am a convert.
